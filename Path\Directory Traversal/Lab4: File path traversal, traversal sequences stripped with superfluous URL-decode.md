# Lab4: File path traversal, traversal sequences stripped with superfluous URL-decode

We try a standard path traversal payload

The request is blocked, as the application detects ../ sequences.

We encode the / character as %2f

The server decodes it back to ../../, recognizes the traversal attempt, and blocks the request again.

Encode the already encoded / once more (%2f â†’ %252f)

On the first decoding pass, %252f becomes %2f.
On the second decoding pass, %2f becomes /.
The application filter only catches the raw ../ sequence, so this bypass works.
