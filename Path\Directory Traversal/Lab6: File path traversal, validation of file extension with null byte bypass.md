# Lab6: File path traversal, validation of file extension with null byte bypass

The %00 character represents a null byte, which is commonly used in exploits against C- or PHP-based applications, where strings are terminated with \0. By appending .png after the null byte, we can bypass the applicationâ€™s file extension validation.

If the application enforces that the filename ends with .png, we can set:

filename = ../../../etc/passwd%00.png

The server sees this as a valid .png file. However, if the application is vulnerable to null byte injection, the system ignores everything after the null byte. As a result, only ../../../etc/passwd is processed, allowing us to access the restricted system file while bypassing the extension check.
