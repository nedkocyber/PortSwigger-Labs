This document serves as a comprehensive cheat sheet summarizing the most common web application vulnerabilities encountered during penetration testing and bug bounty assessments.
It is designed as a quick-reference guide for both offensive security professionals and defenders, providing a condensed yet technically accurate overview of each vulnerability class.

Each entry in the table below includes:

**Difficulty** – how complex the vulnerability is to exploit in real-world conditions.

**Severity** – the potential impact or damage if successfully exploited.

**Frequency** – how often the issue is observed in modern applications.

**OWASP Top 10 Mapping** – the corresponding category from the OWASP Top 10 framework.

**Attack Type** – whether the issue is client-side (executed in the browser) or server-side (executed on the backend).

**Detection Level** – how easy or hard it is to identify during manual or automated testing.

**Common Tools** – popular utilities, scanners, and frameworks typically used to detect or exploit the vulnerability.

**Real-World Impact** – what a successful attacker can achieve in practice (e.g., data theft, code execution, account takeover).

**Possible Escalation** – higher-level consequences such as full system compromise, privilege escalation, or lateral movement.

**Mitigation** – defensive techniques, configurations, or coding practices that can prevent exploitation.

This cheat sheet can be used as a lightweight vulnerability matrix to quickly assess application security posture or to structure penetration test reports.
It combines information from OWASP, PortSwigger Web Security Academy, and practical pentesting experience, offering a clear snapshot of the web attack surface.

By scanning across the columns, security testers can immediately determine:
Which vulnerabilities are most dangerous (high severity, high difficulty).
Which ones are most common (frequent and easy to detect).
Which security controls or mitigations should be prioritized.
This format helps teams visualize the relationship between exploitability, impact, and defensive maturity — effectively bridging the gap between theory and practical testing.
