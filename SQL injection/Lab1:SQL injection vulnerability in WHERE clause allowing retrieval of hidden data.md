The easiest way to spot an SQL injection is by identifying parameters in the URL or in POST requests. You can then test them with common payloads and observe the output. Most of the time, testing directly from the browser won’t work, so using Burp Suite is preferred. Burp not only allows you to intercept and modify requests, but also provides detailed insight into what’s happening behind the scenes, making it much more effective for finding vulnerabilities.
